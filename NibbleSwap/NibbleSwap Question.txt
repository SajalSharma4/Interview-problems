A nibble is a four-bit aggregation or half an octet. There are two nibbles in a byte. 

Given a byte, swap the two nibbles in it. 

For example, 100 is represented as 01100100 in a byte (or 8 bits). The two nibbles are (0110) and (0100). If we swap the two nibbles, we get 01000110 which is 70 in decimal.
